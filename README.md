## üß© Model & Dataset  
- **Model:** YOLOv8 (small/medium versions)  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic images and YOLO annotations from Falcon Editor, covering these safety equipment classes:  
  - OxygenTank, NitrogenTank, FirstAidBox, FireAlarm, SafetySwitchPanel, EmergencyPhone, FireExtinguisher

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run on Google Colab

1. **Dataset Setup**  
   - Download the synthetic dataset as a ZIP file from Falcon's secure link.  
   - Upload the ZIP and related files manually to your Google Drive.  
   - Mount Google Drive within your Colab notebook to access the data seamlessly.

2. **Run Training Notebook**  
   - Open the provided `.ipynb` notebook in Colab.  
   - Paste and execute the cells in sequence.  
   - After uploading and mounting the dataset, **update file paths** inside the notebook as needed.

3. **Update `yolo-params.yaml`**  
   - Modify the dataset path entries in `yolo-params.yaml` within Colab to reflect the mounted Drive paths where the dataset resides.  
   - This step is crucial to ensure YOLOv8 training references the correct dataset location.

4. **Training and Evaluation**  
   - Run the training with YOLOv8 parameter settings from `yolo-params.yaml`.  
   - Evaluation metrics such as mAP, precision, and recall will be generated automatically.

## üîç Interpreting Inference Graphs

- Training logs and graphs display key model performance indicators over epochs, including loss curves and precision-recall metrics.  
- A decreasing training and validation loss curve indicates the model is learning effectively.  
- The mAP@0.5 metric shows detection accuracy per class; higher values (close to 1.0) reflect better performance.  
- Precision and recall graphs show the model's balance between correctly finding objects and avoiding false detections.  
- These graphs support validation of the model‚Äôs robustness and readiness for deployment.

## üèÅ Quickstart with Streamlit App (USE CASE)

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/nidhi-ii24/hackaura-yolo-app.git
    cd hackaura-yolo-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install streamlit ultralytics
    ```

3. **Download Model Weights**
   - Place your trained `final.pt` (or `best.pt`) into the project root (same folder as `streamlit_app.py`).

4. **Run the Streamlit Webcam App**
    ```
    streamlit run streamlit_local.py
    ```
    - The app will open in your browser.  
    - Click "Start Webcam" to see live detection (bounding boxes & confidence scores).
  
5. **To directly access the Deployed WebApp**
   - follow the link [https://hackaura-yolo-app.streamlit.app/]
   - When file run locally it can access the webcam on a video feed, but deployed app can only access the photos to run detection.

## üñºÔ∏è Notes on Expected Outputs & Their Interpretation

- **Interface:** Webcam video stream overlays colored boxes and class labels (with confidence scores) for each safety object detected.
- **Classes:** OxygenTank, NitrogenTank, FirstAidBox, FireAlarm, SafetySwitchPanel, EmergencyPhone, FireExtinguisher.
- **High-confidence detections:** Only objects passing confidence threshold (default 0.5) are shown for robust safety monitoring.
- **Sample Image:** See results folder for annotated examples and accuracy screens.
- **Output Meaning:** Bounding boxes correspond to real-world object locations. Confidence score indicates prediction certainty. Consistent results across lighting, occlusions, and backgrounds demonstrate project robustness.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **No webcam detected?** Restart app, ensure permissions, disconnect from other software (e.g., Zoom).
- **Streamlit error?** Upgrade/reinstall with `pip install --upgrade streamlit`.
- **Model not loading?** Check `best.pt` path and dependency versions. Verify torch installation for GPU support.
